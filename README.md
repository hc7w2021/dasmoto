# Dasmoto's Arts & Crafts

## Fonts

I noticed the <h3>'s and <p>'s were also Helvetica so I added CSS to style them as such even though the spec didn't specifically ask for that.  Without it they were Times New Roman.

## Divs

I also added <div>'s even though there was no menu or list.  I used id's to target them since each section is unique.

## Spans

To style the prices I used the <span> tag and added a class.  I've heard that it is not best practice to style a whole tag.  So even though this is a small project I added a class to them anyway.
